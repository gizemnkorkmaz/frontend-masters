Higher-Order Functions

Challenge 1

Create a function addTwo that accepts one input and adds 2 to it.

Challenge 2

Create a function addS that accepts one input and adds an "s" to it.

Challenge 3

Create a function called map that takes two inputs:
an array of numbers (a list of numbers)
a 'callback' function - a function that is applied to each element of the array (inside of the function 'map')
Have map return a new array filled with numbers that are the result of using the 'callback' function on each element of the input array.
map([1,2,3,4,5], multiplyByTwo); //-> [2,4,6,8,10]
multiplyByTwo(1); //-> 2
multiplyByTwo(2); //-> 4
  
Challenge 4

The function forEach takes an array and a callback, and runs the callback on each element of the array. forEach does not return anything.
let alphabet = '';
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
forEach(letters, char => alphabet += char);
console.log(alphabet);   //prints 'abcd'

Challenge 5

For this challenge, you're going to rebuild map as mapWith. This time you're going to use forEach inside of mapWith instead of using a for loop.

Challenge 6

The function reduce takes an array and reduces the elements to a single value. For example it can sum all the numbers, multiply them, or any operation that you can put into a function.
const nums = [4, 1, 3];
const add = (a, b) => a + b; 
reduce(nums, add, 0);   //-> 8
Here's how it works. The function has an "accumulator value" which starts as the initialValue and accumulates the output of each loop. The array is iterated over, passing the accumulator and the next array element as arguments to the callback. The callback's return value becomes the new accumulator value. The next loop executes with this new accumulator value. In the example above, the accumulator begins at 0. add(0,4) is called. The accumulator's value is now 4. Then add(4, 1) to make it 5. Finally add(5, 3) brings it to 8, which is returned.

Challenge 7

Construct a function intersection that compares input arrays and returns a new array with elements found in all of the inputs. BONUS: Use reduce!

Challenge 8

Construct a function union that compares input arrays and returns a new array that contains all elements. If there are duplicate elements, only add it once to the new array. Preserve the order of the elements starting from the first element of the first input array. BONUS: Use reduce!

Challenge 9

Construct a function objOfMatches that accepts two arrays and a callback. objOfMatches will build an object and return it. To build the object, objOfMatches will test each element of the first array using the callback to see if the output matches the corresponding element (by index) of the second array. If there is a match, the element from the first array becomes a key in an object, and the element from the second array becomes the corresponding value.

Challenge 10

Construct a function multiMap that will accept two arrays: an array of values and an array of callbacks. multiMap will return an object whose keys match the elements in the array of values. The corresponding values that are assigned to the keys will be arrays consisting of outputs from the array of callbacks, where the input to each callback is the key.

Challenge 11

Create a function commutative that accepts two callbacks and a value. commutative will return a boolean indicating if the passing the value into the first function, and then passing the resulting output into the second function, yields the same output as the same operation with the order of the functions reversed (passing the value into the second function, and then passing the output into the first function).

Challenge 12

Create a function objFilter that accepts an object and a callback. objFilter should make a new object, and then iterate through the passed-in object, using each key as input for the callback. If the output from the callback is equal to the corresponding value, then that key-value pair is copied into the new object. objFilter will return this new object.

Challenge 13

Create a function rating that accepts an array (of functions) and a value. All the functions in the array will return true or false. rating should return the percentage of functions from the array that return true when the value is used as input.

Challenge 14
Create a function pipe that accepts an array (of functions) and a value. pipe should input the value into the first function in the array, and then use the output from that function as input for the second function, and then use the output from that function as input for the third function, and so forth, until we have an output from the last function in the array. pipe should return the final output.

Challenge 15
Create a function highestFunc that accepts an object (which will contain functions) and a subject (which is any value). highestFunc should return the key of the object whose associated value (which will be a function) returns the largest number, when the subject is given as input.
